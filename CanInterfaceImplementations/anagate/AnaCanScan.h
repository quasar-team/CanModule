	 * Method that initialises a can bus channel. The following methods called upon the same object will be using this initialised channel.

	 * @param name: Name of the can bus channel. The specific mapping will change depending on the interface used. For example, accessing channel 0 for the
	 * 				16 port systec interface usb1 would be using name "st:9", while in socket can the same channel would be "sock:can0".
	 * 				for anagate, this is a ":" separated string with three elements, example: "an:0:128.141.159.194"
	 * 				with:
	 * 				 "an" = anagate library
	 * 				 0 = the physical module port (if multiport), 0=A, 1=B etc etc
	 * 				 a.b.c.d = the IP number (here, out lab module)
	 *
	 *
	 * @param parameters: Different parameters used for the initialisation. For using the default parameters just set this to "Unspecified"
	 *
	 *              for anagate we have a string of 6 parameters separated by whitespace, i.e. "125000 0 0 0 0 0"
