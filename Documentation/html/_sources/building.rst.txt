Building

.. get supported languages for code-blocks with: pygmentize -L lexers
.. this shows a huuuge amount of languages available, I choose basemake 
.. for cmake stuff

We use `cmake`_ 3.0 or higher for multi-OS building.
The dependencies are:

* `xerces`_-c 
* `boost`_ (1.64.0 or later preferred, but any version >=1.59.0 should work)
* `socketcan`_ libs (CC7, ubuntu) (not to be confused with the CanModule sockcan.so lib!). 
  They can also be found in various places for open software.
* dependencies for CanModule: LogIt (sources to github pulled in by cmake)
* vendor libs (to be installed on your build/target machine)
* if general vendor builds are off you will build ONLY mockup. Using the toolchain:
	* SET( CANMODULE_BUILD_VENDORS "OFF") or UNSET( CANMODULE_BUILD_VENDORS ) or <nothing>
	* default is therefore "OFF" if you do nothing
* if you need the general vendor builds, and usually that is the case, then you need to 
  switch them on explicitly in the toolchain:
   * SET( CANMODULE_BUILD_VENDORS "ON")
* you can switch off selected vendor builds which you do not need using the toolchain:
	* SET(CANMODULE_BUILD_SYSTEC "OFF")
	* SET(CANMODULE_BUILD_ANAGATE "OFF")
	* SET(CANMODULE_BUILD_PEAK "OFF")
   * by default, all selected vendors are built


**These dependencies should conveniently be injected into cmake using a toolchain file:**

.. code-block:: basemake

	CMakeLists.txt:
	---------------
	(...other stuff)
	#
	# Load build toolchain file and internal checks before we start building
	#
	if( DEFINED CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE )
		message( STATUS "[${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE}:${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_LINE}]: CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE is defined -- including [${CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE}]")
		include( ${CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE} )    
	endif()
	(...other stuff)

**The toolchain file would look like this (i.e. windows):**

.. code-block:: basemake

	toolchain.cmake:

	SET( SYSTEC_HEADERS "M:/3rdPartySoftware/SYSTEC-electronic/USB-CANmodul Utility Disk/Examples/Include")

	##SET( PEAK_HEADERS "M:/3rdPartySoftware/PCAN-Basic API/Include" )
	##SET( PEAK_LIB_PATH "M:/3rdPartySoftware/PCAN-Basic API/x64/VC_LIB" )

**The toolchain gets then injected by running cmake:**

.. code-block:: basemake

	cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchain.cmake
	
	
shared (default) and static linking/loading
-------------------------------------------

CanModule uses all shared libraries, and also loads shared libraries during runtime for each connection
object and vendor. Nevertheless some shared libraries with reduced dependencies are made available 
where possible (they have suffix *-static.so) for linux.
If the vendor APIs come, in some cases, in the form of relocateable static libraries/archives (-fPIC), then they
can sometimes be integrated into the CanModule specific vendor shared lib.

**Linux (CC7, ubuntu):**
if the environment variable CANMODULE_AS_STATIC_AS_POSSIBLE=1 is set during building the *-static 
libs are produced with boost and other specific dependencies integrated as possible:

* ancan-static.so
* sockcan-static.so
* CanModule-static.so

During execution, CanModule(-static.so or .so) looks for the standard shared libs.
If you want to use the "reduced dependencies" versions then the env var CANMODULE_AS_STATIC_AS_POSSIBLE=1
has to be set **during runtime** as well.

**Windows**

No reduced dependencies libs are available at this point.
