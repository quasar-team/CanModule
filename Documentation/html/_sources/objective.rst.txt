**CanModule** is a software abstraction layer, written in C++, to simplify integration
of CAN bridges from different vendors into cmake (C++) projects needing CAN connectivity
for windows and linux. A CAN bridge is - usually - an external module which is connected
on one side to a computer or network and offers CAN ports on the other side where CAN buses
can be connected.

The original authors are the CERN Atlas-DCS team, support is now done by BE-ICS-FD.


Supported OS
------------

These operating systems are supported for all vendors

* CERN CC7 
* Windows 2016 Server and Windows 10

other OS versions might be available on special request, or easily be ported to. 
 
compatible vendors
------------------

CAN bridges from vendors are compatible with CanModule and are tested
 
* `AnaGate`_
* `SysTec`_ 
* `Peak`_ 

These vendors produce many types of CAN bridges, **CanModule supports presently the USB (Peak, Systec) 
and ethernet (Anagate) bridges**. Flexible datarate bridges (PEAK FD) and other interface types 
(PEAK .m2 or also PCI) might be added if needed.

Integration into projects
-------------------------

In order to use CanModule in your  project/server/code there are two ways 

* by source-clone from `CanModuleGitlab`_ and integrated into a cmake build chain.
* binaries to copy for other build chains are available CERN-wide from `NexusCan`_ .
