`Peak`_
=======

All modules from vendor `Peak`_ are handled by class PKCanScan (windows) or CSockCanScan (linux) which 
both manage the modules through their underlying vendor specific API according to the OS. 
Both classes provide the standard generic CanModule API. 
Here the underlying vendor specific classes and the specific parameters are documented. 

The modules from the families PCAN USB and USB Pro are supported. For linux, also the flexible 
datarate (FD) types are supported. The FD types are not supported for windows presently, but they
could be added in principle if requested.

The connection
--------------

To connect to a specific port for I/O, and send CAN messages, the following methods are used.


windows
^^^^^^^

the connection to a specific port for I/O is created by calling

.. doxygenclass:: PKCanScan 
	:project: CanModule
	:members: createBus, sendMessage
	
and communication takes place through peak's open-source PCAN-Basic windows library. Only "plug-and-play"
modules with USB interface and fixed datarate (non-FD) are supported by CanModule for now. PEAK's flexible datarate (FD)
modules can be added later on (they need some different API-calls and more complex parameters), and also
other interfaces like PCI are possible for windows.The implementation is based on the PCAN-Basic driver.

linux
^^^^^

The open-source socketcan interface is used on top of peak's open source netdev driver. Both Peak's
fixed and flexible datarate are working, although the fixed modules are recommended for bus compatibility.
Only modules with USB interface are supported. 
The peak driver source is freely available and it can be configured to build several
types of drivers, where we use peak's netdev driver only. See `PeakDriver`_ for details on this.
A PCAN-Basic driver is also available but the netdev driver is more performant and modern. The 
PCAN-Basic driver is used nevertheless for windows, and it offers better compatibility for all module
families. 

Unfortunately the peak linux driver does NOT provide deterministic port numbering through socketcan. On a 
system with several PEAK bridges the port specification "sock:can0" is mapped to **any**
of the existing peak bridges (and the electronics can burn becuase you dont). In order to overcome this limitation for peak
(it really is a design error in their driver) an extended port identifier must be used: "sock:can0:device1234".

CanModule then performs a udev system call and internally remaps the ports, so that "sock"can0"device1234" 
will correspond to the first port of device 1234. The internal mapping is deterministic since the devices
can always be ordered ascending.

      
**The rest of the calls are standardized again**:   

.. doxygenclass:: CSockCanScan 
	:project: CanModule
	:members: createBus, sendMessage
	

sockets are used normally, using linux' built-in CAN protocols:

.. code-block:: c++ 

 mysock = socket(domain=PF_CAN, type=SOCK_RAW, protocol=CAN_RAW)


API example Windows
-------------------

This is how the CanModule standard API is used for peak for windows.

.. code-block:: c++

 libloader = CanModule::CanLibLoader::createInstance( "pk" ); // windows vendor libs
 cca = libloader->openCanBus( "pk:can0", "250000" ); // termination on frontpanel
 CanMessage cm; // empty
 cca->sendMessage( &cm );


API example Linux
-----------------

This is how the CanModule standard API is used for peak for linux, USING the EXTENDED PORT IDENTIFIER.
(also see jira OPCUA-1735).

.. code-block:: c++

 libloader = CanModule::CanLibLoader::createInstance( "sock" ); // socketcan
 cca = libloader->openCanBus( "pk:can0:device1234", "250000" ); // termination on frontpanel
 CanMessage cm; // empty
 cca->sendMessage( &cm );
