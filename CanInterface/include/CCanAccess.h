 * one (singleton) global signal for errors independent of bus. This is needed to listen to bus opening/creation errors where the bus does not yet exist.
 * All buses and errors go into this signal.
 *
 * The recommendation is:
 *    connect a handler to the global signal
 *    open the bus
 *    if successful, connect bus specific handlers for errors, receptions, port status changes
 *    if not successful, keep global handler and try again (server logic)
 *    of course you can keep the global handler connected as well, but you might also disconnect it (let the sigleton object go out of scope)
 *
 * boost::signal2 need implicit this-> pointers to work, that means they only work as methods of existing objects. So we need a class
 * for specifically implementing the globalErrorSignal, which is independent of the existence of lib and bus instances.
